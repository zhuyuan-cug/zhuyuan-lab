D3Impute: Distribution-aware Modeling, Dropout-aware Modeling, and Density-guided Imputation for scRNA-seq data.

MATLAB Users
For new datasets:
-Step 1: Run 00_Parameter.m to perform grid search and tune parameters. 
-Step 2: Run 01_D3Impute.m to perform imputation.
For existing datasets:
-Directly run 01_D3Impute.m to perform imputation.

Python Users
Simply run D3Impute.py to execute the imputation pipeline. The default demo dataset is Siletti. You may replace it with your own data.

Benchmarking & Visualization
MATLAB version includes:
- Clustering performance comparison across 13 algorithms (02_methodCompare.m)
- 14 types of visualizations including t-SNE, error metrics, memory/runtime plots (03_Plot.m)
